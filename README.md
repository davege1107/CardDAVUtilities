# CardDAVUtilities

1. Backup of Google, iCloud, Yahoo and AOL contacts using CardDAV
2. Purge of Yahoo and AOL contacts. This option is missing from Yahoo and AOL WebUI

Backup Python3 programs generate combined vcf file that contains all contacts of Google/Yahoo/AOL/iCloud accounts on folder contacts_xxxxxx (where xxxxxx is yahoo, google etc.)

Replace xxxxxxxxx@gmail.com / xxxxxxxxx@yahoo.com / xxxxxxxxx@icloud.com / xxxxxx@aol.com by your real Gmail/Yahoo/iCloud/AOL email and set your Application Password

Google: You have to enable 2FA. Then generate Application Password to be used to login to CardDAV server of Google.

Please note: Google CardDAV server is an "undocumented feature" and could stop working any time.
